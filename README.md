# Credit Card Loan Default Prediction

This project is a machine learning model built using Logistic Regression to predict whether a person will default on their credit card loan. It is designed as part of an academic project to demonstrate practical application of supervised learning.

## Project Objective
To predict credit card loan default using a logistic regression model trained on historical data. The aim is to assist financial institutions in assessing loan risk more effectively.

## Model Details
- **Algorithm Used**: Logistic Regression
- **Accuracy Achieved**: 95%
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Platform Used**: Google Colab

## Dataset
- The dataset used for this project was taken from GitHub.
- It contains information such as income, loan, age, loan to income, and more features related to credit card usage.

## Key Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Model training using logistic regression
- Evaluation using classification metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score
- Confusion matrix for performance visualization

## Files Included
- `credit_default_prediction.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook containing the complete code
- `README.md`: This file

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository or download the notebook.
2. Open it in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run each cell in order after uploading the dataset (if needed).
4. View the prediction results and performance metrics.
